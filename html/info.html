<p>MetalNetDot is an unblocked games site based off of the code of "The Flash Archive" on Github. The main url is <a href="http://10.0.0.210">10.0.0.210</a>, which is self-hosted. Though if it's down, you can go to <a href="0288007.github.io/metalnetdot/html/index.html">0288007.github.io/metalnetdot/</a> which always be up. But due to GitHub Pages only supporting static website code, the chatroom only works on the self-hosted server.<br><br> Anyways, this network contains Flash games (and animations), including a few DOS games and some games ported to HTML5.<br><br> And a fancy shmancy chatroom with a login page allowing you to talk about whatever you want! (As long as it isn't illegal and/or traumatizing). Plus a song player on the menu that plays a different song depending on the day of the month! If you don't like the music, mute the website. <br><br>That's kind of it, so stay safe and don't get caught lacking! And the snitches get stitches and also no bitches. Oh yeah and please share this with your friends :D</p>
