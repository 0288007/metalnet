welcome..
This is an unblocked games website made by Jacek of UCHSK.
This was built off of a github repo i forgot the name of.
It has flash games, flash animations, minecraft, and some MS-DOS games.

Shoutout to Nicolas, Diana, James, Xander, Riley Knight, Luca, Matt, Archie, Mannie, Nicky, Josh and Oli of Radford, my mum, my doggie Zahara, my dad, and some other people i probably forgot about.

The code that sets the song played based on the day of the month was generated by ai. Theres also a downloader for YouTube and other social medias in the misc folder somewhere.
